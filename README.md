# interlock-aws-example

Production-grade telecom ETL pipeline demonstrating [Interlock](https://github.com/dwsmith1983/interlock) pipeline orchestration on AWS. Generates synthetic CDR and SEQ data, processes it through a bronze/silver medallion architecture, and orchestrates the full pipeline with SLA monitoring.

**Interlock framework:** [github.com/dwsmith1983/interlock](https://github.com/dwsmith1983/interlock) | [Documentation](https://dwsmith1983.github.io/interlock)

```

Two data streams flow through three layers:

| Layer | Description | Trigger |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Raw** | Gzipped JSONL from generator Lambda | EventBridge rate(15 min) |
| **Bronze** | Delta Lake with hashed phone numbers | Kinesis (S3 PutObject events) |
| **Silver** | Spark aggregations (hourly + daily) | Interlock sensor-driven |

### Interlock Orchestration

Six pipelines are defined in `pipelines/` as declarative YAML:

| Pipeline | Type | Trigger | Job |
|----------|------|---------|-----|
| `bronze-cdr` | Event | Sensor `hourly-status` complete | Audit Lambda |
| `bronze-seq` | Event | Sensor `hourly-status` complete | Audit Lambda |
| `silver-cdr-hour` | Event | Sensor `audit-result` match | Glue `cdr-agg-hour` |
| `silver-seq-hour` | Event | Sensor `audit-result` match | Glue `seq-agg-hour` |
| `silver-cdr-day` | Event | Sensor `daily-status` all hours | Glue `cdr-agg-day` |
| `silver-seq-day` | Event | Sensor `daily-status` all hours | Glue `seq-agg-day` |

Silver pipelines are fully event-driven — no cron schedules. The bronze consumer writes per-period sensor records to DynamoDB (one row per hour, one per day). When a sensor satisfies the trigger condition, the stream-router starts a Step Functions execution for that period.

### Per-Hour Execution Model

Each hour gets its own sensor record and SFN execution:

- Sensor key: `SENSOR#hourly-status#2026-03-04T10`
- Execution name encodes the hour: `silver-cdr-hour-2026-03-04T10-...`
- Glue receives `--par_day` and `--par_hour` arguments
- SLA deadline `:30` resolves to `T10:30:00Z` for hour 10

Daily pipelines accumulate completed hours in a StringSet. When all 24 arrive, `all_hours_complete=true` fires the daily SFN.

## Data Streams

- **CDR (Call Detail Records)** — probe-level pings from phone calls (~100M records/day default)
- **SEQ (Sequence/Probe)** — probe-level pings from internet browsing (~500M records/day default)

### Schemas

**CDR** — one row per ~10s probe ping during a phone call:
```json
{"phone_out": "2125551234", "phone_in": "3109876543", "cell_tower": "3f7a2b1c", "time": "2026-03-01T14:03:27Z"}
```

**SEQ** — one row per ~10s probe ping during internet browsing:
```json
{"phone_number": "4695551234", "cell_tower": "a8c2e4f1", "host_name": "www.youtube.com", "site_name": "YouTube", "time": "2026-03-01T14:07:12Z"}
```

### Session Model

Records are generated from temporally correlated **sessions**, not independent random samples:

- **CDR**: Each phone call is a session (exponential duration, mean ~2 min). A 2-minute call produces ~12 consecutive records with the same phone pair. 90% stationary (same tower), 10% mobile (tower handoffs via adjacency graph).
- **SEQ**: Each browsing session is 10-60 minutes with 3-15 site visits. Within a site visit, host_name is constant. Streaming sites (YouTube, Netflix) produce more pings.

Traffic follows a bimodal time-of-day distribution (peaks at 10 AM and 8 PM, trough at 3 AM). Generation is **deterministic and idempotent** — seeded by `sha256(stream + window_start)`.

## S3 Layout

```
s3://{bucket}/
  {stream}/par_day=YYYYMMDD/par_hour=HH/{stream}_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMM}_{part}.jsonl.gz  (raw)
  bronze/{stream}/par_day=YYYYMMDD/par_hour=HH/*.parquet                              (Delta)
  silver/{stream}_agg_hour/par_day=YYYYMMDD/par_hour=HH/*.parquet                     (Delta)
  silver/{stream}_agg_day/par_day=YYYYMMDD/*.parquet                                  (Delta)
```

Each raw file contains up to 100K records (~1.5-3 MB gzipped). Bronze and silver layers use Delta Lake format.

## Reference Data

- **2000 cell towers** across 50 US metro areas (~40 per metro) with adjacency graph for mobility
- **500K phone numbers** (seeded, deterministic)
- **~500 websites** with Zipf popularity weights

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform >= 1.5
- Python 3.12
- Go 1.24 (for building Interlock Lambdas)
- Docker (for building the Delta Lake Lambda layer)

### Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build the Delta Lake layer (one-time, requires Docker)
make build-delta-layer

# Build all Lambda and Glue artifacts
make build-all

# Initialize and deploy infrastructure
make tf-init
make tf-apply

# Restart EventBridge schedules (required after first deploy)
make restart-schedules
```

Or in one step after initial `tf-init`:

```bash
make deploy   # runs tf-apply + restart-schedules
```

### Backfill Historical Data

```bash
# Generate data from a specific date to now
./scripts/backfill.sh 2026-03-01
```

The backfill script invokes the generator Lambda for every 15-minute window from the start date to the current time.

### Manual Invocation

```bash
# Test CDR generation for a specific window
aws lambda invoke --function-name dev-telecom-generator \
  --payload '{"stream":"cdr","daily_target":1000000}' /dev/stdout

# Check output
aws s3 ls s3://{bucket}/cdr/ --recursive
```

### Teardown

```bash
# Empty S3 bucket first (required for destroy)
aws s3 rm s3://{bucket} --recursive

make tf-destroy
```

## Cost Estimate

Costs depend heavily on data volume. Glue is the primary cost driver.

| Resource | What Drives Cost | Est. Monthly |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Glue** (4 jobs) | 50 runs/day × 2-5 G.1X workers | $50-300 |
| **Lambda** (7 functions) | Generator 3 GB × 60s, bronze 2 GB × 10s | $8-15 |
| **S3** | 7-day lifecycle, ~15 GB/day at full scale | $3-5 |
| **CloudWatch** | 7-day log retention, ~5 GB/month ingested | $2-3 |
| **DynamoDB** (4 tables) | On-demand, low volume | $1-2 |
| **Step Functions** | ~50 executions/day × 12 transitions | < $1 |
| **Kinesis** | On-demand, ~2K events/day | < $1 |
| **EventBridge** | ~3K events/day | < $1 |
| **Total** | | **$65-330** |

**Reducing costs:**
- Lower `cdr_daily_target` / `seq_daily_target` in `variables.tf` — Glue jobs finish faster
- Reduce `glue_hourly_workers` from 2 to 1
- Stop EventBridge schedules when not testing (`make restart-schedules` to resume)
- At minimum scale (~1M records/day), expect ~$30-50/month
